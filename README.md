<h3 align="center">Hi! :wave: I'm Kelsie (she/her).</h3>

<hr>

I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA entering the second year of my career. Most recently, I worked on a team utilizing Twig/PHP/Symfony, Vue.js/Nuxt, HTML, Sass, and TypeScript. I've been working with HTML for almost 5 years professionally, and nearly a decade as a hobby.

I have a well-rounded, full-stack education consiting of a web development certificate from Seattle Central College (2019) and an intensive, bootcamp-style internal training program (2021). Although I work primarily in the front end, I also have experience with and am comfortable navigating setups with Node.js, Docker, SQL, and Python.

My current project is a recipe creator app in React and GraphQL. What's next? We'll see what lies ahead!

<h4>Fun facts:</h4>

:large_blue_circle:  Music is one of my all-time greatest passions. You can find my experimental dream pop music over on Bandcamp or Soundcloud. Maybe someday you'll see me play live again ;)

:large_blue_circle:  I almost went to culinary school! Food is another huge love of mine. I love experimenting in the kitchen and mixing ingredients together in fun ways. I also have an educational background in food science, so feel free to ask me if that scary sounding ingredient name on your bag of chips is really that bad.

:large_blue_circle:  My newest obsession is creating ceramics using the pottery wheel. Working with my hands is such a great stress relievor after staring at a screen all day.
